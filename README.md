##### WolfWatch is available in several languages:
- English
- Français
- Deutsch
- Español
- Italiano
- Custom Languages

### How to have a personalized language?
       
To have a custom language you have to go to the WolfWatch files.                                                                  
So go manually in the software files or then open the software,                                                                 
then go to the settings tab and click on "Show files"                                                                                   
                                                                 
Then go to the "Settings" folder, then in this folder, copy paste a file in ".lang"                                                    
it will serve as a template for your custom language.                                                                 
                                                                 
Open this file with notepad, or notepadd ++ (or other software)                                                                 
And change the messages of the file!                                                                 
                                                                 
Information:
